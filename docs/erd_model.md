# Startup ERD Model
I created this ERD by reverse-engineering the startup’s database in MySQL Workbench:

* Ran a PK/FK query to identify all primary and foreign key relationships.

* Mapped the relationships visually in the ERD: the central and left areas display core table connections, while stand-alone tables appear on the far right.

* Delivered this diagram to the Startup Founder to provide a clear, actionable overview of the database structure, aiding future optimization and refactoring efforts.
